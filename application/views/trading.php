					<p>Execution Quality is one of the most important factors you should consider when you are choosing a Forex company. Being ex-interbank dealers ourselves we realise that inferior execution can turn a profitable trading strategy into a losing one. Tight spreads make no sense when you cannot trade on them. That’s why we do our outmost to provide you with the best execution possible.	</p>

Alternatively you may trade via telephone, speaking directly with one of our dealers. Once you open a position it remains open until the matching closing trade is executed. Open positions are constantly revalue at the current market price, updating your account balance in real time.</p>
					
					<h1>Guaranteed fills on market orders up to 40 lots (4 million)</h1>

However, when the price has moved significantly you will be filled at the best available price. This can be in the client’s favour or against. Spreads may widen. Forex Ray makes every effort to keep these enlargements as low and rare as possible through its partnerships with multiple liquidity providers.</p>
